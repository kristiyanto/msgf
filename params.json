Identification is performed by utilizing [MSGF+ tool developed by PNNL](https://omics.pnl.gov/software/ms-gf), and Quantification is conducted by utilizing MSnbase, bioconductor pacakge by Laurent Gatto et. all.\r\n\r\n*NAME* uses Bioconductor proteomics image as the base image.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nTo run *NAME* Docker engine must be installed. Click [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for a detailed information to install Docker engine on various operating system including Windows and MacOS.\r\n\r\nProtein identification and quantification is a computationally intensive process. Depending on the size of the data, at least 4Gb available memory on the Docker Machine is required. Click here for more information on increasing the memory allocation for Docker engine on VirtualBox machine for MacOS and Windows Users.\r\n\r\n[Image]\r\n\r\n### Input\r\nThe container takes Mass Spectrometry  (MS2) data (*MZML, -add here-) and peptide sequences files (*.fasta). It is advised to put only the files to be computed in the folder as a separate sessions (e.g. different project for each folder).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the files are accessible on FTP server, a CSV file with the information about the files can as the input. The container reads the information, download the files and run the computation.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the folder must be mounted to the container's \"/root/data\".\r\n\r\n### Output\r\nFor each MS2 file provided, a MZID file containing the protein identification is generated. When the pipelines completed, a file `LabelledQuant.csv` or `LabelFreeQuant.csv`, and `SpectrumCount.csv` are also generated. `LabelledQuant.csv` or `LabelFreeQuant.csv` is the quantified result for either Labelled or LabelFree respectively. `SpectrumCount.csv` contains more detailed information including Spectrum No, Pep Sequence, and e-value that may be useful for filtering and further analysis. \r\n\r\n### Running the container\r\nMake sure to put the files to compute on a separate folder under the system Users files.\r\nOn Windows, usually starts with /c/Users/YOURWINDOWSUSERNAME\r\nOn MacOs, usually starts with /Users/YOURMACUSERNAME\r\nON Linux, there is no restriction.\r\n\r\nTo run the container (LabelFree):\r\n```\r\ndocker pull kristiyanto/msgf:labelfree\r\ndocker run --rm /c/Users/path/to/your/file:/root/data kristiyanto/msgf:labelfree\r\n```\r\nTo run the container (Labelled):\r\n```\r\ndocker pull kristiyanto/msgf:itraq\r\ndocker run --rm /c/Users/path/to/your/file:/root/data kristiyanto/msgf:itraq\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contact and Information\r\nYou are invited to contribute for new features, updates, fixes by sending pull requests.",
